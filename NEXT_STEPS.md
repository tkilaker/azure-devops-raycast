# Next Steps for Publishing

## Current Status ✅
- Extension is fully functional and running locally
- All hardcoded organization references removed
- Error handling and validation added
- Icon created
- Git repository initialized
- MIT license added

## To Use Locally (Already Done)
The extension is already available in your Raycast when you run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## To Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository named `azure-devops-raycast`
3. Run these commands:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/azure-devops-raycast.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Before Publishing to Raycast Store

### Required Fixes
1. **TypeScript Errors**: The React 19 type compatibility issues need resolution
   - Consider downgrading @types/react further or updating Raycast API
   
2. **Screenshots**: Add actual screenshots to README
   - Take screenshots of all three commands in action
   - Save as `assets/screenshot-*.png`

3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test with different:
   - Organizations
   - Projects
   - Work item types
   - Edge cases (no permissions, expired PAT, etc.)

### Nice to Have
1. **Caching**: Add caching for work items list
2. **Pagination**: Handle large result sets
3. **Filters**: Add more filtering options
4. **Performance**: Optimize image downloads

## Publishing Process
Once ready:
```bash
npm run publish
```

This will:
1. Create a pull request to [raycast/extensions](https://github.com/raycast/extensions)
2. Raycast team will review
3. Once approved, it's live in the store!

## Estimated Timeline
- Local use: ✅ Ready now
- GitHub repo: 5 minutes
- Fix TypeScript issues: 1-2 hours
- Add screenshots: 30 minutes
- Submit to store: 15 minutes
- Review process: 3-7 days

## Support
The extension works great locally! The TypeScript errors don't affect functionality, just the strict build process for store submission.
